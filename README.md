## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Firebase


### What I learned

This was my first time using firebase and so I used this project to learn the basics of firebase which is a real-time database that takes away the stress of writing a whole backend for your application. It is not as complicated as configuring a backend with nodejs. An overall nice experience. I hope to use it more in the future.
